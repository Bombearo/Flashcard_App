# Flashcard App

A basic flashcard app that integrates with an online database

I made this project to test out Tkinter, and to familiarise myself with Python OOP, and to consolidate my knowledge using insertion sort.

## Installation
To use this basic flashcard app, you will need some sort of database connection. After setting up the database connection, you can import the database using the app.sql file.

You will be prompted to "Login", but if you don't have an account registered in the database, you'll have a guest account until you register with a password.
